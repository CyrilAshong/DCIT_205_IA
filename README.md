* Unofficial COMPSSA Website <br>
This is an unofficial page for the Computer Science Department of Ghana. It has 10 pages which consist of the home page, faculty, research and tech news. The website highlights courses offered at the department as well as events and activities offered at the department.
## Features
* The website has a top navigation menu for easy traversal between the pages.
* There is also a quick-access menu at the bottom of each page that provides a link to all the other pages making navigation easier. 
* The footer at the end of each page provides information on the location of the department and an email address to direct concerns and make inquiries.
