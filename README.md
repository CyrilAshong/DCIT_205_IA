# Project Title: Computer Science Development Website

## Inroduction
This project involved creating a website for the Computer Science Department. The goal was to provide a platform that showcases the department's programs, faculty, and student work.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

## Development Process
1.**Planning**: Before starting the actual coding, I spent time understanding the requirements and the goals of the website. I also research similar websites to gather ideas'

2.**Design**: I sketched out a rough design of the websites, outlining where key features would be placed. This helped me visualize the end product and served as a roadmap during the coding process.

3.**Coding**: With the design in hand, I began coding the website. I started with the HTML structure, then styled it with CSS, and finally added interactivity with JavaScript.


## Challenges and Solutions
1.**Challenge**: One of the main challenges I faced was making the website responsive accross different devices.
  **Solution**: I used media queries in CSS to adjust the layout based on the screen size, ensuring the website looked great on all devices.

## What I've Learned

This project was a great experience for me.

1.**Importance of Planning**: Before this project i underestimated the importance of planning. Now, I understand that having a clear plan in place is very crucial for succesful project execution.

2.**Responsive Designs**: I learned a lot about making a website responsive. It was challenging to ensure the website looked good on all devices, but i learned useful techniques like using media queries in CSS.
